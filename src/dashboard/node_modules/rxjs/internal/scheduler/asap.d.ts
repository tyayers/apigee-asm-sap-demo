 *
 * `asap` scheduler behaves the same as {@link asyncScheduler} scheduler when you use it to delay task
 * in time. If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing
 * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.
 *
 * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code
 * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called "deferring".
 * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves
 * some (although minimal) un
